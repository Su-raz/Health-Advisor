The "Health Advisor" project is a web-based application designed for disease diagnosis and health guidance. Leveraging supervised learning techniques, particularly the support vector model, it offers users the capability to diagnose diseases based on input symptoms. Additionally, the system provides valuable supplementary information such as recommended medications, precautionary measures, and dietary advice tailored to the diagnosed condition. Through this comprehensive approach, users can receive personalized health recommendations, enhancing their understanding and management of various medical conditions.
